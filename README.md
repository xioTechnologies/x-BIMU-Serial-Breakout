x-BIMU-Serial-Breakout
======================

x-BIMU serial breakout board

* FTDI compatible 6-way male header (x-BIMU UART inputs are 5 V tolerant)
* Pull-down resistor on CTS input means that hardware flow-control connections are not necessary
* 3.1 mm diameter mounting holes (position = 31 mm x 27 mm)
* All components are SMD and on top side only and no copper on bottom side allow PCB bottom to be adhered to surfaces without risk of damage

Version history
